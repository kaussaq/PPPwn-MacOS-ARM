# PPPwn-MacOS-ARM

This is an altered version of the PPPwn build-macarm.sh to replace the one provided in the flow's folder PPPwn:
https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn

Replace the file in this repo with the file in the original download. This will handle Homebrew + Docker for you, as well as cleaning up after itself by removing Docker.
